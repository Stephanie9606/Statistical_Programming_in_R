# **STAT 412/612 Statistical Programming in R, Fall 2020**

**2.1 Administrative Information**

**Time**: 5:30 - 8:00 pm

**Instructor**: Dr. Richard Ressler

  * Email: [rressler@american.edu](rressler@american.edu)
  
  * Office: On Zoom
  
  * Phone: Canvas Chat or Direct Message
  
  * Office Hours: *By Appointment Only, on Zoom*
    
**2.2 Materials**

  * Required Hardware and Software:
    + *Computer capable of running R 4.0*
    + Current version of R
    + Current version of RStudio
    + Current version of tinytex or LaTeX
  
  * Books and other references are free and online:
    + See the following URL: [R for Data Science by Wickham and Grolemund (O’Reilly)](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/%20and%20style.tidyverse.org)

**2.3 Grading**

**2.3.1 Attendance and Engagement**
  
  * Attendance at each class is expected.
  * If I am unable to make it I will notify the instructor in advance if at all possible.           If unable to do so, I will inform the instructor using Canvas Direct Message as soon            as possible after class.

**2.3.2 Homework Assignments**
    
  * There will be approximately nine homework assignments throughout the semester of varying possible scores
  * Each will require me to submit a properly-knitted PDF file and the original .Rmd file on Canvas
  * I may receive assistance from tutors, other students, and the professor, but *my submissions must be composed of my own thoughts, coding, and words*
  * If I have to copy code from an online resource such as stackoverflow, I will cite my source and be specific about which pieces of code I copied and any changes I made to them. Failure to do so is a violation of AU’s Academic Integrity Code.
  * Late assignments will be accepted but **there will be a scoring penalty**
      
**2.3.3 Final Project**

  * My project will involve working with 2-4 classmates on a fairly large real-world dataset to answer some question of interest.
    
**2.3.4 Final Grades**

  * I should be able to explain my work on assignments and the project and my rationale.           Based on my explanation (or lack thereof), the professor may modify my grade
  * My final grade will be determined by:
      
**Element**              | **412** | **612**
------------------------ | ------- | ------
Attendance and Engagement| 10%     | 5%
Assignments              | 60%     | 60%
Final Project            | 30%     | 35%

**2.3.5 Possible Curve**
  
The final grades may be based on a curve if the median is below 85. A visual representation of possible curves follows:
    
![](statxxxcurve-1.png)

**2.4 Other Notes**
  
  * Sometimes we may need to type in-line math expressions such as $A=\pi*r^{2}$
  * We may also write equations using display form as $$ \bar{x} = 1/n \sum_{n=1}^n x_i $$
  * We may also need to refer to code in a text block as one can find the number of cars in the mtcars built-in dataset using the nrow() function
